# FlashSocket.IO

Flash library to facilitate communication between Flex applications and Socket.IO servers.

The actual websocket communication is taken care of by my fork of gimite/web-socket-js project.

This project wraps that and facilitates the hearbeat and en/decoding of messages so they work with Socket.IO servers
